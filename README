Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
============================

Project Overview
----------------
This project implements a minimal Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in VHDL for educational
and experimental purposes. The design supports a simple 2x2 or NxN systolic array of
Processing Elements (PEs), each including a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit and a basic
activation function.

The TPU can be simulated using GHDL or synthesized for FPGA targets. It is organized
to provide modularity and clarity, allowing further extensions such as larger arrays,
more complex memory systems, or additional interfaces.

Requirements
------------
- VHDL-2008 compatible simulator (e.g., GHDL)
- Optional: FPGA synthesis tool for hardware implementation

Building and Simulation
----------------------
1. Compile VHDL sources with your preferred simulator:

       ghdl -a src/hdl/core/mac.vhd
       ghdl -a src/hdl/core/pe.vhd
       ghdl -a src/hdl/core/systolic_array.vhd
       ghdl -a src/hdl/memory/bram_model.vhd
       ghdl -a src/hdl/control/fsm_controller.vhd
       ghdl -a src/hdl/top/tpu_top.vhd

2. Elaborate the top-level design:

       ghdl -e tpu_top

3. Run simulation:

       ghdl -r tpu_top --vcd=tpu_top.vcd

4. Open the waveform file with GTKWave or your preferred viewer:

       gtkwave tpu_top.vcd
